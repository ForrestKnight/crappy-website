# Hilariously Bad Website

*This website is intentionally poorly designed, but with actual usability and Easter eggs for y’all to find.*

- Welcome gif
- Under construction
- **Change the cursor to a loading animation**
- Reverse scrolling (after 4 seconds say or on recognizing scrolling, have popup say “you’re scrolling the wrong way, idiot”)
- No white space + starry night or crazy color crappy graphics background
- Comic sans + times new romans (a lot of text)
- Captchas everywhere (or just one gnarly captcha)
- Random bright colors for text and labels
- Popups (that are actually manageable) error messages, chat box, cookies that you have to say yes to… plus include sfx on some
- Small text or icons that lead to an extra page/Easter egg
- Bait buttons that don’t do anything but inconspicuous text that are buttons
- Random keyboard that you have to use with your mouse
- Slow scroll for ToS (disable scroll + ALT?)
- Important paragraph that goes off the screen
- Horizontal scrolling, but just a little bit
- Exit button that doesn’t exist but grows in size as you click (have an inconspicuous exit button)
- Normal button but the clickable area is small, like 5px and not in the center
- Add some password protections (click on a random spinning gif to popup password?)
- Broken links
- Crappy navigation
- Text misalignment
- Some background music but make it difficult to turn off
- Misleading labels
- Make button taller on hover
- Some captcha images are tiny and some are giant
- Infinite scrolling on a second page to make someone think there’s a surprise at the bottom
